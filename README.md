### 👋 Hi, I’m Abdulmejd

🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering at AAU

😭 Trying to balance Uni courses with Udemy Courses, but it's been a rough ride. 

### My Struggle

I started this journey full of hope and enthusiasm. I dreamt of becoming a great software engineer, contributing to amazing projects, and building a GitHub profile full of perks and achievements. But reality has been harsh.

😞 **Lazy Habits**: I often find myself procrastinating, putting off difficult tasks for later. The comfort of easy wins and the fear of challenging problems have been my constant companions.

😩 **Fear of Failure**: The thought of tackling difficult concepts paralyzes me. Instead of pushing through, I sometimes avoid them altogether. This fear has held me back from reaching my full potential.

💔 **Falling Behind**: With each passing day, the gap between where I am and where I want to be seems to widen. The university assignments pile up, Udemy courses remain unfinished, and my GitHub contributions are sparse.

### Hope for the Future

Despite these setbacks, I haven't given up entirely. Each day is a new chance to overcome my fears and break free from the cycle of laziness. I still hope that one day, my GitHub will be a testament to my growth and resilience.

For now, this profile serves as a reminder of my journey — the struggles, the failures, and the determination to keep trying.

Stay tuned, and perhaps one day, you'll see a transformation.
